Own The Spot is the most recent addition to the list of projects that i'm working on. The aim of the Own The Spot startup is to create a platform and social media for skateboarders. From our research this seems to be an un-tapped market and the concept comes from a skateboarding video game that uses a similar idea.

We've recently hit our MVP goals and are live on the play store. Our next plan is to improve the current platform with feedback from user feedback as well as set up our continuous deployment system. As well as continue to add new features.

*  AngularJS

*  Django

Repository: __Private__

[Website](http://www.tandlr.com/)

[Apple Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tandlr-tutoring/id1074984935?mt=8)

Google Play Store: __TBD__

I've joined the startup Tandlr quite recently and been a fun ride so far. Tandlr's aim is to create a platform that allows for students to connect with tutors and mentors to increase their grades.

Been developing there for about 4 months now and it's interesting working on a tech stack that's already existing and production ready. All of my work has been on the webapp and i've had to completely rework the previous system to meet the new requirments of management.

## NGHT-Barscan

### NGHT

Technology Used

*  React Native

*  Redux

*  GitLab

*  Expo

Repository: __Private__

Website: __DEPRECATED__

Google Play Store: __DEPRECATED__

Apple Store: __DEPRECATED__

<img src="../../public/images/NGHT_login.jpg" style="width: 200px; display: inline;"/>
<img src="../../public/images/NGHT_home.jpg" style="width: 200px; display: inline;"/>
<img src="../../public/images/NGHT_detail.jpg" style="width: 200px; display: inline;"/>

Where to begin with this project...I joined the startup NGHT around October 2017 and helped build the app from the ground up. The intention of the app is to provide people with a way to find deals and simplify their nightlife experience.

We have plans to integrate POS system connections with bars across The United States and Canada but that was put on hold due to business reasons.

After about six months with NGHT and aquiring my own share of equity in the company we decided to merge companies with a competitor who was also a student, that's how BarScan comes into play.

### BarScan

Technology Used

*  Ionic

*  FireBase

*  GitLab

Repository: __Private__

[Website](http://barscanapp.com/)

[Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.locusmobileapp&hl=en)

<img src="../../public/images/Barscan_news.jpg" alt="Drawing" style="width: 200px; display: inline;"/>

Once we were situated with the merge of NGHT and BarScan it was time to merge the applications as well as inherit a _LOT_ of new code. We are mostly sticking with BarScan's stack since it's more robust and later in the development stage than NGHT's.

It does make me sad at times that the whole stack and app that I built for NGHT isn't going to be used anymore but I guess that's how things are in life.

It is quite interesting to see where this will go since it's been about a year now in total with both startups.

## Aesthetic Kanji

Technology Used

*  React Native

*  FireBase

[Repository Link](https://github.com/chernandez7/Aesthetic-Kanji)

<img src="../../public/images/A_kanji_2.png" style="width: 200px; display: inline;"/>

This project was actually inspired by two things: A color pallete I saw on a UI site and for my love of 日本語 (Japanese). It was also my first time using a DataBase.

I was studying vocabulary and kanjo heavily with help of a flash card app and I wondered if it would be difficult to implement my own. I was commited on using the color pallete that I had found and it ended up looking pretty nice in my opinion.

Currently the FireBase integration is working and the app state pulls in the thousands of kanji. Which I would call a success. But the project isn't finished yet, maybe someday i'll continue it.

## Moon Phases

Technology Used

*  C++

*  OpenGL

[Repository Link](https://github.com/chernandez7/Moon-Phases)

<iframe width="720" height="404" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gjB-TBw-Pcc?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

This project started as the final project to my PHYS 102 (Astronomy) course, while the requirments stated that we were supposed to make a diorama I convinced my professor to let me create a piece of software.

In this project I went really in-depth into OpenGL, it's performance, and how it's camera system works. I ended up making an engine that simulates the phases of the moon throughout the year.

This project wasn't very difficult to make but much harder than a diorama in my opinion. It did give me a good insight as to how it can be difficult to create a finalized product for an audience. Since each platform would need a different release.

## Relativiti

Technology Used

*  Nodejs

*  Polymer

*  Cordova

*  Travis CI

[Repository Link](https://github.com/Rhernandez513/Relativiti)

This project started as the final project to my COMP 374 (Software Engineering) course and was meant to be a webapp that took in audio and converted it to sheet music. It was never finished so I don't have a final video to show, but I do have some test videos.

<iframe width="720" height="404" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/LDq3luUazs4?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

This project was my first time using JavaScript and HTML. Also the first time that a project was rigorously documented and planned before it was started. First time creating build scripts and continuous deployment across multiple platforms.

Since I was fairly new and the project was pretty ambitious it never got past the stage of parsing out note Hz into actual note values (which is fairly difficult). But this project did lead to the revitalization of my universities ACM student chapter.

I would love to make a derivative of this project or continue it one day though.

## Game of Life

Technology Used

*  C++

*  OpenMP

*  Travis CI

[Repository Link](https://github.com/chernandez7/Game-of-Life)

The Game of Life project started as the final project for my COMP 364 (High Performance Computing) course. I had access to and made use of the [TACC Supercomputer](https://portal.tacc.utexas.edu/user-guides/STAMPEDE) for parallelization in this project.

Benchmarks and analysis are in the repository so i'll leave this one as it is, but I will say that working with a huge amount of power and compute nodes really is fun.

## Boids

### SFML Implementation

Technology Used

*  C++

*  SFML

[Repository Link](https://github.com/chernandez7/Boids.git)

<iframe width="720" height="404" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0RdnN7Sg1jA?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

This project began as the final project to my COMP 271 (Data Structures) class. Originally I wanted it to be done in pure OpenGL but due to time constraints, I opted for SFML which wraps OpenGL quite nicely for C++.

As seen in the video above, I was able to get around ~120 bird-oids without framerate drops. The program itself wasn't very efficient so I wanted to remake the project one day.

I ended up doing that for my COMP 398 (Independent Study) course.

### CUDA Implementation

Technology Used

*  C++

*  CUDA

*  OpenGL

[Repository Link](https://github.com/chernandez7/cuda-boids)

<iframe width="720" height="404" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8TYSsUS-DBk?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

This time around I had a whole semester and a lot more experience as a developer. I ended up using CUDA for computing in parallel and OpenGL, this time I had some goals.

I wanted to:

*  Improve efficiency

*  Add the z-axis

*  Use OpenGL and CUDA together

Since I had some High Performance Computing knowledge up my sleeve now, this was a bit easier to do. Some troubles came from the new libraries and hardware acceleration that I didn't know too well but it worked out. Another interesting thing was that I had access to the [TACC Supercomputer](https://portal.tacc.utexas.edu/user-guides/STAMPEDE) which allowed me to run my implementation on a distributed system.
